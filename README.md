## Description

This is a simple TypeScript program that creates two interfaces of Persons (User and Admin) which takes in properties of each type of person. It creates and array of persons anf filters through this array based on the type of Persons (User and Admin) through the filteredData function. The function strictly returns User[] for "user" and Admin[] for "admin". It also prevents filtering by type. The criteria (age) also dynamically adjust based on the person type.
